# Simon_Game
Simon is an electronic game of short-term memory skill.
The app follows the pattern of the real game. Each button make a specific sound when clicked(but not only when clicked, and when the player gets the next button to click and follow the pattern), depending on he color of the button. If the pattern is incorrect, the game will end and make specific sound, otherwise if the pattern is correct, the game will continue and the level will increase.
